            Knights of St John International berthed in Nigeria on the 26th day of June, 1976 here at Holy Ghost Cathedral Enugu
            with Col Kevin Ejiogu as the Pioneer Worthy President. ………… brothers have presided over this order as Worthy Presidents.
            I am today the ……… Worthy President of Holy Spirit Commandery #414 Knights of St John International incorporated under
            the special laws of New York in CAP 284 of the laws of 1886 – New York. The law in its section 2 says: “The object of
            the said corporation shall be to create and foster a feeling of fraternity and fellowship among the various commanderies
            within this union, to improve their moral, mental and social condition and to aid, assist and support members of their
            families in case of want, sickness or death and to promote the welfare of the Roman Catholic religion.”
            The preamble of the said constitution posit as follows:
            Early in the last quarter of nineteenth century, there assembled in one of the large American cities a number of
            Catholic gentlemen, pledged to inculcate Christian principles, to encourage the practice of civic virtues, to develop
            better conception of public duty and to infuse into human society a broader loftier morality”
            To this end our Agenda shall be:

            <ul>
                <li> To foster a feeling of fraternity and fellowship among brothers</li>
                <li> to encourage the practice of civic virtues;</li>
                <li> to Develop better conception of public duty;</li>
                <li> To infuse into human society a broader loftier morality.</li>
            </ul>
