        <p class="agenda__content">
            Knights of St John International berthed in Nigeria on the 26th day of June, 1976 here at Holy Ghost Cathedral Enugu
            with Col Kevin Ejiogu as the Pioneer Worthy President. ………… brothers have presided over this order as Worthy Presidents.
            I am today the ……… Worthy President of Holy Spirit Commandery #414 Knights of St John International incorporated under
            the special laws of New York in CAP 284 of the laws of 1886 – New York. The law in its section 2 says:
            <br>
            <strong>
                 <i>
                    “The object of
                    the said corporation shall be to create and foster a feeling of fraternity and fellowship among the various commanderies
                    within this union, to improve their moral, mental and social condition and to aid, assist and support members of their
                    families in case of want, sickness or death and to promote the welfare of the Roman Catholic religion.”
                </i>
            </strong>
            <br>
            The preamble of the said constitution posit as follows:
            Early in the last quarter of nineteenth century, there assembled in one of the large American cities a number of
            Catholic gentlemen, pledged to inculcate Christian principles, to encourage the practice of civic virtues, to develop
            better conception of public duty and to infuse into human society a broader loftier morality”
            To this end our Agenda shall be:

            <ul>
                <li> To foster a feeling of fraternity and fellowship among brothers</li>
                <li> To encourage the practice of civic virtues;</li>
                <li> To Develop better conception of public duty;</li>
                <li> To infuse into human society a broader loftier morality.</li>
            </ul>

            We are the first, largest and most experienced Commandery in Nigeria but it seems much is not heard about our
            Commandery. Jesus said in Gospel of Mathew 5:14 - 15
            <br>
            <strong>
                <i>
                    “Nor do they light a lamp and then put it under a bushel basket. It is set on a lampstand where it gives light to all in
                    the house, just so, your light must shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your heavenly
                    father”
                </i>
            </strong>
            <br>
            Within the next four years, we are sure to fraternize and fellowship more than ever – many of us will participate in BOT
            meeting to prepare you for tomorrow’s leadership.
            We must improve our moral, mental and social condition and give aid, assist and support members and their families in
            case of want, sickness or death.

            <ul>
                <li> We must generally promote the welfare of members in particular and that of the Christian Catholic religion.</li>
                <li> We shall make other Commandaries know we are here as primus inter pares.</li>
                <li> We must encourage the practice of civic virtue.</li>
                <li> We must develop better conception of public duty and finally.</li>
                <li> Infuse into human society a broader loftier morality.</li>
            </ul>

            We humbly ask for your support and encouragement. Together we shall bounce back to our pre-eminent position as the
            mother Commandery in Nigeria.
